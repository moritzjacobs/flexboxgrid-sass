# mj-flexboxgrid-sass

A simplified, one file, edit happy adaptation of [hugeinc/flexboxgrid-sass](https://github.com/hugeinc/flexboxgrid-sass), which in turn is an adaption of the original [Flexbox Grid](http://flexboxgrid.com/) created by @kristoferjoseph.

## Changes in this fork
- `container-fluid` is now `container`, if you want a fullsized container, use `container-full`
- removed the `sass-flex-mixin` dependency in favour of using autoprefixer for as much backwards compatibility as you need.
- `mj-gulp-workflow` is used for sass compilation
- improved file structure
